	- 8am - 8pm
	- city: melbourne
	- <1mm rain is ignored (you will wear a hood in winter, in summer it doesn't matter)
	- <30% chance of precip is ignored for <2.5mm of rain
	- >2.5mm rain = bring a brolly/brella
	- open app in morning and it says "bring a brella" yes/no
	- shows max temp for the day

Backlog
	- select time of day
	- select location
	- custom what is rain threshold (>1mm?)
	- forecast for next few days
	- better messages (so can say "Looks nice now but will rain later"?)
	- push notification for "bring a brelloa" yes/no - will need server 
	- tell you how many layers to wear (customisable)
	- take wind into account (e.g. "just a heads up, its gonna be really windy today")
	- show min temp for the day
